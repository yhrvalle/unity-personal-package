# Yhr Personal Package

This is a collection of systems, setup scripts and Actions Map that I want to standardize for my
futures projects. The code maintained here is supposed  to work with any type of project

## Examples of Systems
- Object Pooling
  - Using the Flyweight Pattern + Factory for creating Objects Pooling (credits to [git-amend](https://www.youtube.com/@git-amend/featured) 
for the insights, I'll probably update this system as my necessities grows)
  - Generates an Empty GameObject for each type of flyweight to hold the pooled objects for better organization
- Dependency Injection System (Wip)
- A Tools Script
  - Set up the initial folder structure, sadly I can't copy the personal Actions Map automatically duo to Unity Package Cache restrictions, but just copy and paste it from the Packages folder.
  - Import some necessary packages (Cinemachine or another other package you use often)
  - Import some Unity Asset Store I use often (Unity Dark mode, PrimeTween and BetterHierarchy)
- Personal Input Action Map
  - A pre-configured Input Action Map with common actions already set up
- Input System using the Actions workflow
  - Can use Properties or Events to handle inputs, needs to create an Scriptable Object that holds the Interfaces generated by the Input System C# class (also shoutout to [git-amend](https://www.youtube.com/@git-amend/featured) for this abstraction layer)
  
- Update Manager (Wip)
